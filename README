A simple python project template for making buildout-enabled projects.

After cloning, run:

    python bootstrap.py
	bin/buildout
	bin/test
	
Assuming no errors, you are good to go!  I suggest renaming the `project_rename` folder to something more appropriate.  Make sure to change references in `setup.py`, `buildout.cfg`, and anywhere else it shows up.
